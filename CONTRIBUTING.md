# GitHub Issues:

- We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue that must be fixed directly in our source code. Thank you for your careful consideration!
- When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and other information about your environment such as browser, browser plugins, operating system, storage type, memory size, and processor
- Note that all issue subscribers receive an email notification from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for discussions, questions or expressing personal opinions
- Open a new issue and connect the PR regarding that issue and put a symbol, tag on it 
- Either it's a bug fix, or feat etc
- Contact us or a community member if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives our team the opportunity to improve the docs and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of handling unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by responding to comments

# Submitting Pull request: 

- Follow our step-by-step guide to learn how to submit new features, bug fixes, and documentation enhancements.


- Pull Requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation, dependencies, and tools contained in the nodejs/node repository. 

- Be aware that reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources on our side. It can therefore take several weeks if it is not just a small fix, especially if extensive testing is needed to prevent bugs from getting into our stable version.

# Creating Bug Reports

- Before reporting a bug, please use our Troubleshooting Checklists to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not (yet) been clearly identified: post your question in GitHub Discussions
