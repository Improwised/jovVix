- First clone the repository on your terminal using command given below
```
  git clone https://github.com/improwised/jovVix.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory using:

```
   cd jovVix
```

- Configure your env settings into .env.docker if you want to integrate any changes otherwise keep the default ones

- Then build and run the docker compose file in your environment by following command
```
  docker-compose up --build
```

- Your app is now running successfully and you can access it on the ip:port as :
```

## Documentation

## Architecture Overview:

### System Architecture

- **Backend:** jovVix uses a Golang backend to handle the server-side logic.
- **Frontend:** Vue.js and nuxt framework is employed for a single-page application (SPA) architecture and component-based development.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used to handle concurrent requests and manage data efficiently.
- **Caching:** Redis is utilized for caching and manipulating users' data and requests, improving performance.
- **Authentication:** The app leverages Ory Kratos for user authentication and uses SMTP services for password recovery and email verification flows.
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets are implemented for handling multiple sessions and managing cookies effectively.
- **S3 bucket:** We have used s3 bucket for storing images into object storage, you can setup the minio for local development


 ### API Overview:
- locally you could start your API server by running the following command :
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/docs
```
- This would open the swagger documentation

- **Backend:** jovVix uses a Golang backend to handle the server-side logic.
- This would open the swagger documentation

 ### Upgrading and changelog:

- It's being managed in this file: CHANGELOG.md

## Contributing to jovVix:
- You can see the contribution guidelines here : [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Code of Conduct:
- This platforms also provides the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Developer

## Guide:
If you're a developer looking to contribute or modify jovVix, here is a brief guide to get started: [Getting started](#getting-started-for-local-setup-from-source) OR, you could just `docker-compose up`

### Code Structure Overview:

- app/: Contains Vue.js components for the quiz interface and holds frontend pages and all
- api/: Contains Golang source code for the server-side logic.

## Setting Up MinIO for Local Development:

- MinIO is used in jovVix for object storage, enabling features like storing and serving images. Below is a guide to setting up a bucket in MinIO for local development.
- We already have added the minio service into our docker-compose file so you just have to start the service
- Then open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:9001.
- Log in using the credentials defined in our docker-compose.yml (you can change with your own afterwards)
- Once logged in, click the Buckets tab on the left menu and you can create bucket there
- For more detailed information, refer to the [MinIO Documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html)
